# Relocate

<PostMetadata

Our trip to relocate from Los Angeles to Chicago started in late summer with me winning an auction for a Ford E250 on Ebay. This thing came in with only 88359 miles and **zero** rust. I tracked the VIM and the van never left Arizona and even came with curbside delivery. What a win! I did push my luck though as I bought it only by judging the photos and not seeing it in person.

As the van was modified to include a wheelchair lift in the back, the van itself was the high top with extended ceiling version. Only challenge though was to get that thing out. This turned out way harder than expected and also no one had a need for it not even for free.

Once the wheelchair lift was out, I was able to tear out both benches in the back to replace them with a custom built bed with enough storage to fit all of our crap underneath. As the goal was to use this van only for relocation and sell it after arrival in Chicago, the bed only had to survive the trip.

3654, 4255

Ultimately, I used a few 2x4's as well as some leftover planks and was able to spend less than 50$ on it. On top of that was a 4" queen size foam matress.
Besides that, I replaced the battery, brakes, and tires for about 1500$. Neither brakes nor tires looked like they would be able to bring us safely through the mountainous terrain of Colorado.

Our 3week-ish trips starts today! Leaving Los Angeles for Chicago with a route packed full of stops across X states. Moving east to Chicago means having no more access to In-N-Out so I made sure to eat as much as I could (4x4, Triple Triple, Double Double, Cheesebuger) and probably ate myself sick.
Sadly the [Hole-In-The-Wall](https://www.recreation.gov/camping/campgrounds/10332664) campground was closed due to the pandemic but I had some BLM spots written down and we one all to ourselves and arrived just in time for sunset.

The first full night of sleep in our van was great. The mattress was super comfortable and spacious enough for two people. We started the day with some leftover burgers fried up in cheesy tortillas and made our way towards the Grand Canyon. I have never been there, so of course I am super excited.

We arrived in the late afternoon and damn this thing is huuuuge. It's hard to explain without actually standing there and looking far out. Even though we could not get down into the canyon itself (dogs) it was still mindblowing.
We left before sunset and hit our second BLM spot within Kaibab National Forest and had our first selfmade dinner of the trip.

I woke up early and enjoyed the brisk morning within the Forest and shot a sheet of film but was dumb enough to double expose that sheet.
In the end it still turned out excellent.

Time to leave the Grand Canyon for Monument Valley. Sadly the reservation is closed due to the pandemic so we couldn't really make the drive through it, but we still could see it from the distance.

We had a solid four hour drive in front of us but were rewarded with probably the best BLM spot on the whole trip.
I woke up around 2am when someone was pulling into camp. When I went out for a piss, I saw the most spectacular night sky. Similar or better to the one I saw in Inner Mongolia.
I wish I'd taken a photo.

As the loop drive was closed, we just got a peek at Monument Valley and made our ways to our next stop in Arizona - Lake Powell in Page. Day 5 without a shower was enough for us, so we put ourselves up in a Motel after going for a dip in the lake.

After getting a good night sleep in a real bed we went on towards our next stop: Red Canyon Campground in Dixie National Forest.
We arrived shortly after lunch and found a great spot within a few larger pine trees. After settling in, we started our hike just a minute outside of camp. It was pretty hot that day so one of our dogs had to be brought back as the hike was too strenous.
The other one went with me and made the 3-hour hike without issues. Only to wake up the next morning being barely able to walk as she was running up and down the trail looking for chipmunks.

While last nights skies were crystal clear, today Canadian wildfires sent clouds of smoke towards us. Views were still spectacular but the beautiful contrast between lush blue skies and striking orange was missing.

After a quick stop at Kodachrome Basin State Park (which to be honest wasn't too spectacular) we planned to hit the Goblin Valley BLM on UT-12/24, however it was either closed, or we couldn't find access.
We decided to go straight to Moab and rented a room at the La Quinta and got some Thai after the long drive.

Moab was one of the spots where we spent more than a night because the surroundings have so much to offer. Our first destination was [Grandstaff Trail](https://www.blm.gov/visit/grandstaff-canyon-trailhead) where at the end we saw a spectacular sandstone arch. Super fun and easy hike. We were done with the hike fairly late and because Liquor Stores close relatively early in Utah, I was rushed and bought a bottle of Steel Reserve (in addition to regular beer) which messed me up real bad. I drink a lot of shit beer but this was something else.
At least our BLM was top notch, barely anyone around us and we had a beautiful glowing sunset.

Thanks to last nights Steel Reverve binge we had to start the day with McDonalds before heading towards Arches National Park where we
hiked the [Corona Arch Trail](https://www.blm.gov/visit/corona-arch-trail), one of the few hikes that allow dogs. The hike was pretty easy with few climbs and we were rewarded with spectacular views of the Bowtie and Corona Arch.

After a couple days in Moab we continued eastwards towards Colorado. First stop was Mountain Village where took the Gondola to Telluride and had Pizza for Lunch at [Brown Dog Pizza](https://www.browndogpizza.com/).
Our spot for the night was a beautiful BLM spot outside of Ophir surrounded by pine trees and mountains. We enjoyed a lazy afternoon reading books and I shot some film.

I didn't expect it to get that cold, but we woke up to frozen windows and [barely functioning gas canisters](https://www.outdoors.org/resources/amc-outdoors/outdoor-resources/why-does-my-canister-stove-fail-in-cold-weather/). It wasn't a real issue though as the sun would soon rise above the mountain ridge and warm us up.

Instead of driving back, we took a detour going south on our way to Chicago and made our way towards Cortez close to Mesa Verde to check out two super interesting ancestral puebloan structures of the American Southwest the next day.
We hit the local grocery store to stock up on food and treated us to another night at a Motel.

While [Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park](https://www.nps.gov/blca/index.htm) wasn't too impressive (guess we were spoilt at this point) the lunch at [Jimmers BBQ, Burgers, & Beers](https://jimmersbbq.com/) made up for it. Double beef patty, pulled pork, Bacon, and onion rings. Solid A.
This night we stayed outside of Montrose at some random BLM and it was creepy with chopped off cow legs lying around.

Not sure where we stayed
We hiked the 4 miles long [Haviland Lake Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/colorado/haviland-lake-trail) and treated us to some pizza and a motel.

Before we left Glenwood Springs we visited [Kid Curry's](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Kid-Curry) grave and then went for some donuts at [Sweet Coloradough](https://sweetcoloradough.com/). Until then I didn't know that open carry was legal in CO.

Woke up at another great BLM spot that was completely empty. We really tried finding something interesting to see in Kansas but there is nothing. We stopped for some BBQ at [Gates](https://gatesbbq.com/) but that was about it.
Full day drive of about 500 miles and pulled in late at our BLM spot. The farther you are from the West, the harder it gets to find public land to camp on.
