# New York

The plan was to explore the city with my large format camera but it looked like we were headed for a full-blown pandemic. New York might shut down, and as I didn't want to risk being stuck there, I had to pack up shop mid-way through.

Despite this, I managed to get a few sheets of film exposed and dropped off at the lab before heading back towards Los Angeles. Today I received them back, finished scanning and post-processing.

I shot plenty of black-and-white all over Queens and the Bronx, and even though _The Infamous_ came out freaking 30 years ago, looking at them reminds me of that record. Still, the above photo fits best into my other shots of city landscapes.
