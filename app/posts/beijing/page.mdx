# Beijing

<PostMetadata created="01/20/2020" page="app/posts/beijing/page.mdx" />

After three years, my time in Beijing is over. Looking back at all the memories and friends made I am thankful and aware of how lucky I was.
Moving there, I didn't know anyone and had to start from the very beginning. It sucked but I think that exactly this struggle shaped me in many different ways.

What drew me to Beijing was my desire to see a part of the world that was completely unfamiliar to me. The city itself seemed perfect, an enormous metropolis with 20+ million residents, modern yet filled with tradition.

Its layout is highly influenced by the development of its inner city surrounding the [Forbidden City](https://smarthistory.org/the-forbidden-city/). When I first arrived, I lived in the northwest corner along the fourth ring road. Later on, I moved closer towards Dongzhimen (东直门) around the northeast corner of the second ring road.

The city is surrounded by mountains on three sides — to the north, west, and northeast — while the southeastern areas and city center open out onto the North China Plain. This lower elevation made it ideal for exploration. Although Beijing's public transport system is excellent, I bought a scooter within my first few weeks there. Thanks to the flat terrain, I could stretch each battery charge further and explore even more of the city. I really regret not tracking my trips exploring the city.

Beijing has its own distinct local identity. It has been the historical capital for centuries and compared to a city like Shanghai, it always felt more honest. People would jaywalk; scooters would drive against the stream of traffic. Overall, following rules felt more relaxed.

By the time I left, the city and China itself were undergoing a lot of change. Even though I did not follow local news and politics, I could see how a lot of traditional [Hutongs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hutong) were torn down and had to make way for newer construction.
