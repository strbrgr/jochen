# Hi, I'm Jochen.

I'm a software engineer. Currently, I work as Technical Lead at [nvisia](https://www.nvisia.com/), where I build distributed and highâ€‘performant software within the financial space.

On weekends and evenings, I shoot photos with my large format cameras, crank out pizzas for friends, or skateboard.

Feel free to check out [my resume](https://www.linkedin.com/in/strbrgr), or find out what I am doing [now](/now).
