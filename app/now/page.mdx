#### Books (finished)

- [Breakneck: China's Quest to Engineer the Future](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/223736214-breakneck) by Dan Wang. _Not a bad book but simplistic in its view to some extend with a lot of repetition. Never saw the US as a lawyerly society but it makes sense._
- [Small Town Sins](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61796658-small-town-sins) by Ken Jaworowski. _What a ride. Probably my favorite book of 2025._
- [An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18170143-an-astronaut-s-guide-to-life-on-earth) by Chris Hadfield. _First Canadian to walk in space._
- [Understanding Distributed Systems](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56977420-understanding-distributed-systems) by Roberto Vitillo. _Highly recommend, great introduction to Distributed Systems._
- [The Force](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32075859-the-force) by Don Winslow. _Pretty solid novel._
- [The Outsiders](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/192566704-the-outsiders) by S. E. Hinton. _I don't care if it's a YA novel, but I liked it!_
- [The Software Engineer's Guidebook](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/201545491-the-software-engineer-s-guidebook) by Gergely Orosz. _It's all right._
- [Hard Rain Falling](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6553843-hard-rain-falling) by Don Carpenter. _Was looking for something along the lines of Bukowski._
- [Butcher's Crossing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/457228.Butcher_s_Crossing) by John Williams. _Western classic, beautiful language._
- [Ghost in the Wires](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10256723-ghost-in-the-wires) by Kevin Mitnick. _Enjoyed it. Hacking just for the sake of it._
- [Sandworm](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41436213-sandworm) by Andy Greenberg. _Zero-days and hackers — I liked it but wish there was more insight into the actual malware._
- [The Three-Body Problem](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20518872-the-three-body-problem?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_18) by Cixin Liu. _Not too much of a sci-fi geek but it was a pretty good read._
